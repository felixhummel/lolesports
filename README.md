This is a draft for a hackable version of http://euw.lolesports.com/vods/.

Features:

- fetches stuff from euw.lolesports.com
- generates a list of games (grouped by matches)
- sets Youtube's quality to 720p by default
- adds dummy links, so there is no spoiler.

Deps:

- Python 2.7
- [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
- [envoy](https://github.com/kennethreitz/envoy)

Run:

    make

Use the source, Luke!
